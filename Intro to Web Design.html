		Web design is the visual aesthetics and page layout of a website. It goes hand-in-hand with web development in the creation of a static website or dynamic web application.
		Even if you don’t consider yourself a creative person, it’s still a good idea to learn web design. No matter whether you want to make static websites or dynamic web applications, design is an important part of the process. The design is the first thing people notice when they arrive on a website, and if it’s not good enough, they’ll leave. You don’t want to create a site that frustrates people, do you?
		If you do identify yourself as a creative person, you might even consider a career as a web designer. Today, there is a huge need for competent web designers with up-to-date skills. It’s not an opportunity to be sneezed at.<br>
